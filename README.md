API for EMR Integration with Traditional Medicine
This project provides a conceptual API framework for integrating an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system with the NAMASTE portal and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2). The code is a starting point and requires customization to be fully functional.
Disclaimer: This is a conceptual template. The actual implementation requires access to specific API documentation and credentials for the NAMASTE portal and the target EMR system.
Project Structure
This repository contains two main server implementations:
•	app.py: A Python API built with Flask.
•	server.js: A Node.js API built with Express.
Choose the one that best fits your development environment. Both versions include placeholder logic to illustrate the necessary API endpoints and data flow.
Dependencies
Python (app.py)
To run the Flask server, you need to install the following libraries:
•	Flask: For the web framework.
•	requests: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
•	python-dotenv: To manage environment variables securely.
Install them using pip:
pip install Flask requests python-dotenv

Node.js (server.js)
To run the Node.js server, you need to install the following packages:
•	express: For the web framework.
•	body-parser: To parse incoming request bodies.
•	axios: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
•	dotenv: To manage environment variables.
Install them using npm:
npm install express body-parser axios dotenv

Configuration
Before running the code, create a .env file in the root directory and add the following placeholder environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and URLs.
# ICD-11 API Configuration
ICD11_API_URL=[https://id.who.int/icd/entity/](https://id.who.int/icd/entity/)
ICD11_CLIENT_ID=your_icd11_client_id
ICD11_CLIENT_SECRET=your_icd11_client_secret

# NAMASTE API Configuration (Note: This is a conceptual placeholder)
NAMASTE_API_URL=[https://namaste.example.com/api/](https://namaste.example.com/api/)
NAMASTE_API_KEY=your_namaste_api_key

# EMR System Configuration (Conceptual)
EMR_API_URL=[https://emr.example.com/api/](https://emr.example.com/api/)
EMR_API_KEY=your_emr_api_key

Core Functionality
Both APIs provide the following conceptual endpoints:
•	/search-codes: Takes a search query and returns relevant codes from either the ICD-11 TM2 module or the NAMASTE system. This endpoint demonstrates dual-coding capabilities.
•	/submit-diagnosis: Takes patient diagnosis data, including both a NAMASTE diagnosis and an ICD-11 TM2 code, and submits it to the EMR system. This adheres to the principle of "dual-coding" for global and national standards.
•	/get-patient-records: Retrieves patient data from the EMR system.
Next Steps
To make this code fully functional, you must:
1.	Obtain API Documentation and Keys:
o	Securely register for and obtain API keys for the official ICD-11 API from the WHO.
o	Obtain the API documentation and credentials for the NAMASTE portal. Note: This may require a formal partnership or direct communication with the relevant Indian government bodies.
o	Secure the API documentation and access tokens for your specific EMR system.
2.	Implement the Integration Logic:
o	In the get_icd11_codes and get_namaste_codes functions (Python) or getICD11Codes and getNAMASTECodes (Node.js), replace the placeholder code with the actual HTTP requests and authentication logic as per the API documentation you acquire.
o	Implement the logic to submit a structured payload to your EMR system's API in the submit_diagnosis_to_emr function. This payload must be carefully constructed to comply with India's EHR standards (e.g., FHIR, HL7).
3.	Error Handling and Security:
o	Enhance the error handling to gracefully manage failed API calls and invalid data.
o	Implement robust security measures, including input validation and proper token management, especially for production environments.
This conceptual framework is designed to give you a clear roadmap for building a fully compliant and interoperable solution.
